# Ethical Use Policy

Ethical use is a core principle of this project.

Telegram poll engagement tools should be used responsibly and transparently. Artificial engagement should never be used to mislead users, manipulate decisions, or create false representations of public opinion.

Best practices include:

- Supporting real community interaction
- Avoiding deceptive practices
- Respecting audience trust
- Using engagement tools to improve visibility, not distort outcomes

Unethical usage may harm both community trust and platform integrity.
